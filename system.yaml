## A simple YAML configuration to be used
## To change the implementation for a specific input --> write the needed implementation name 
## at the associated index within the Power2 implementation list
## In this example: 
##      2 -->  power_by_addition
##      3 -->  power_by_self_mul
!system
algorithm: 'Pythagorean'
modules: {
  Power2: [power_by_addition, power_by_self_mul], ## Power2 has 2 imps --> first is for 1st input and second for the 2nd input
  add: normal_add ## AD module has one implementation in this example
} 
inputs: {2, 3} ## Input vector: mapped to Power2 list of implementations using Index value
